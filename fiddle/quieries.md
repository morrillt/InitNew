## General Instructions
we are making the html css for a simple chat experience that is similar to the ux of slack and your own experience chatgtp in this page.

Can you generate a simple 3 section website with materialize.css. section two goes to the right of section 1, section 3 goes to the right of section 2, and section 4 goes to the right of section3. All the sections should be in a container class with 90% margins.

Make the html and css different as well as a .js file.

You will give me the files and I will have comments and revisions. Each time i ask for a revision before sending the code make a message that includes

: A version of the new revision so I can reference previous revisions if needed, each time you do a revision put the version number in the title tags with the name of the project, ie Chat Experience 1.0, Chat experience 1.01 Chat experience 1.02 etc, each new version changes the version of the title .01. 
: A summary of the changes made, and a summary of the reasony why you made those changes.


 I would like for you to do extensive commenting in the html and css.

 each time there is a new section or subsection please you a couple lines of comments so they are easy to see

## Section 1 'Chats'
This ux should be inspired  by facebook messenger and has 3 parts for each line item exactly like messenger.
this section is 2 columns wide
there does not need to be a h1 for this section

part 1: a photo 50x square

part 2: a name first name then last name be sure to indent enough so its not overlapping the photo

part 3: an orange badge to the right of name with a number 1, 2, 3

a photo of the person, generate a random photo and name. Each photo is about 50px square just like messenger

 The 10 options are randomly generated names and faces and this works just like facebook messenger, you select the friend you want to chat with. Hovering over the chat should change the color to light grey.



# Section 2 'Chat Experience"
Section two has two subsections 2.a -which is a conversation area. and 2.b whitch is a reply area, again inspired by facebook messenger.

2.a "Conversation area"
Section two is two columns wide, and stretches from top to bottom of the screen. it has the entire chat historty in it, there should be a sample conversation in this area between bob and jen. Each time the speaker changes the background color behind the conversation changes. There is no caption needed for the area, just changing the background color is enough. a small 50x photo of each person is displayed next to each conversation.

2.b "Reply area"
this section is inside of 2.a and is big textg input 8 lines long with a paper airplane icon in the bottom right area.

# Section 3: prompt suggestions
this is 9 columns wide.
in this section there are two sub sections

3.a "Cards"

Cards have headings like M1, M2, or M3.... each card is Numbered in order

There are 6 cards.

under the header is a suggestion of how to possibly respond to the messages, there are 6 possible cards each with real copy of an actual romantic opening as one mind send to someone as a first message  on a dating site.

3.b "Buttons"

There are 5 buttons, each is a different random color. Names are "Funnier" "Wittier" "More Serious" "Combine" "refresh"
